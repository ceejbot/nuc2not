This is a paragraph with some prose in it.^1 It has at least one _footnote_ to spice things up and keep the reader on their toes. It also has a [link reference](one) to nothing in particular because I need to test that as well, and I want to test it in isolation as I develop. I hope you enjoyed reading this.

[^1]: The prose is not very interesting.
